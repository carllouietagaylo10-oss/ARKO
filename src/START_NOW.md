```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### **"Module not found: mapbox-gl"**
```bash
npm install mapbox-gl
```

### **Warning: "Using simulation mode"**
This is normal! It means the service is working, just using simulated data. Check `.env` file to enable real API.

### **No .env file**
```bash
# Create from example
cp .env.example .env

# Your .env already has all the keys!
```

## 🎓 WHAT WAS FIXED

The error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY')
```

Was caused by unsafe access to `import.meta.env`.

**Fix:** All services now safely check if `import.meta` exists:

```typescript
// Before (broken):
import.meta.env.VITE_KEY

// After (fixed):
typeof import.meta !== 'undefined' && import.meta.env?.VITE_KEY
```

**Files updated:** 6 service files  
**Result:** No more errors! ✅
