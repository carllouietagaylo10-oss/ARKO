## 🗣️ **CONVERSATION EXAMPLES:**

### **Enhanced AI Mode Examples:**

**User:** "What's the weather like and should I be worried about flooding?"

**Arko (AI):** "Good afternoon! 🌤️ I'm checking Valencia City's current conditions for you:

**Current Weather:**
- Temperature: 28°C (feels like 32°C)
- Rainfall: 12mm (moderate)
- Humidity: 78%
- Wind: 18 km/h

**Flood Risk Assessment:** 🟡 **MODERATE**

With 12mm of rainfall, you should stay alert. This level puts us in the moderate flood risk category for Valencia City. I recommend:

1. **Avoid low-lying areas** like Riverside Road
2. **Keep emergency supplies accessible**
3. **Monitor updates** - I'll alert you if conditions worsen
4. **Have evacuation routes planned** - Valencia City Gymnasium is 2.1km away

The rain isn't immediately dangerous, but Valencia City's drainage can become overwhelmed quickly. Would you like me to show you evacuation routes or provide a real-time flood map?"

**Actions:** [View Flood Map] [Evacuation Routes] [Emergency Contacts]

---

**User:** "I think there might be flooding on my street. What should I do?"

**Arko (AI):** "🚨 Thank you for reporting this - your safety is my priority! Here's what you should do immediately:

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. **Move to higher ground** within your building (2nd floor or higher)
2. **Do NOT attempt to walk or drive** through flowing water
3. **Take this emergency kit**: Phone, water, flashlight, medicines
4. **Stay connected** - keep your phone charged

**REPORTING & HELP:**
- I can activate **SOS tracking** (hold the red button for 1 second) to send your location to CDRRMC every 5 seconds
- **Report the flooding** using the 'Report Situation' feature with photos
- **Call CDRRMC directly**: +63956-135-2663

**EVACUATION:**
If water rises to dangerous levels:
- **Valencia City Gymnasium**: 8 min drive, 25 min walk (2.1km)
- **Valencia City Hall**: 6 min drive, 18 min walk (1.5km)

**Current conditions show 12mm rainfall - this aligns with your street flooding report. You're in a moderate risk zone that's becoming more dangerous.**

Are you safe where you are now? Do you need immediate evacuation assistance?"

**Actions:** [Activate SOS] [Get Evacuation Route] [Call CDRRMC] [Report with Photos]

### **Local Knowledge Mode Examples:**
